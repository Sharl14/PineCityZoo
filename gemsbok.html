          <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
          <p>
            The Gemsbok is a large antelope native to the arid regions of
            southern Africa. It is known for its striking appearance, with long,
            straight horns and a distinctive black and white facial pattern.
            Gemsboks are well adapted to their harsh environment, able to
            survive without water for long periods by obtaining moisture from
            the vegetation they consume.
          </p>
          <p>
            Gemsboks are social animals and typically live in herds of 10 to 40
            individuals. They are known for their incredible speed and agility,
            which they use to escape predators such as lions and hyenas.
            Gemsboks are primarily grazers, feeding on grasses, leaves, and
            shrubs. Their unique adaptations allow them to thrive in the arid
            landscapes of southern Africa, making them a fascinating species to
            observe in the wild.
          </p>
          <p>
            Gemsboks are also known for their impressive endurance and can
            travel long distances in search of food and water. They are
            primarily active during the cooler parts of the day, such as early
            morning and late afternoon, to avoid the heat of the sun. Their
            striking appearance and unique adaptations make them a popular
            species among wildlife enthusiasts and photographers.
