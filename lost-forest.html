            The Lost Forest is a magical place filled with lush greenery and
            exotic plants. It is home to various species of animals, including
            the elusive red panda and the majestic snow leopard.

            they can observe the unique flora and fauna. The forest is also a
            sanctuary for endangered species, and efforts are made to preserve
            its natural beauty and biodiversity.
