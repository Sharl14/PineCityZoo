          <h3>PANDAS</h3>

          <p>
            Pandas are large, bear-like mammals native to China, known for their
            distinctive black and white fur. They primarily feed on bamboo,
            although they are technically omnivores.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pandas are solitary animals, spending most of their time foraging
            for food and resting. They have a slow reproductive rate, which has
            contributed to their status as a vulnerable species.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pandas are known for their playful behavior, often engaging in
            climbing and rolling around in their natural habitat.
          </p>
          <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
          <p>You will find them at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
