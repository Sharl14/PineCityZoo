          <h3>TIGER</h3>
          <p>
            Tigers are the largest wild cats in the world, known for their
            striking orange coat with black stripes. They are solitary hunters
            and primarily prey on large ungulates.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tigers are powerful and agile predators, capable of running at high
            speeds and swimming well. They are known for their strength and
            stealth, making them effective hunters in their natural habitats.
            Tigers are solitary animals, preferring to live alone except during
            mating season or when raising cubs. They are territorial and mark
            their territory with scent markings and scratch marks on trees.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tigers are found in a variety of habitats, including tropical
            forests, grasslands, and mangrove swamps. They play a crucial role
            in maintaining the balance of their ecosystems by controlling prey
            populations. Unfortunately, tigers face numerous threats, including
            habitat loss, poaching, and human-wildlife conflict. Conservation
            efforts are underway to protect these magnificent creatures and
            their habitats.
