          <h3>KOALA</h3>
          <p>
            Koalas are marsupials native to Australia, known for their
            distinctive appearance and tree-dwelling lifestyle. They have a
            unique diet consisting mainly of eucalyptus leaves, which are toxic
            to most animals.
          </p>
          <p>
            Koalas are primarily nocturnal and spend most of their time sleeping
            in trees. They have a specialized digestive system that allows them
            to break down the tough eucalyptus leaves they consume. Koalas are
            also known for their vocalizations, which can be quite loud and
            distinctive.
          </p>
          <p>
            Koalas are social animals and often live in small groups called
            colonies. They have a strong sense of smell and use scent marking to
            communicate with each other. Unfortunately, koalas face threats from
            habitat loss, climate change, and disease, making conservation
            efforts crucial for their survival.
