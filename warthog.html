          <h3>WARTHOG</h3>
          <p>
            Warthogs are wild pigs native to Africa. They are known for their
            distinctive tusks and bristly hair. Warthogs are herbivores and
            primarily feed on grasses, roots, and fruits.

          <p>
            Warthogs are social animals and often live in groups called
            sounders. They are known for their unique behavior of kneeling on
            their front knees to eat. Warthogs have a strong sense of smell and
            can detect food from a distance. They are also known for their
            ability to run quickly, despite their stocky build. Warthogs are
            primarily active during the day and spend their nights in burrows or
            dens. They are well adapted to their environment and can survive in
            a variety of habitats, including savannas, grasslands, and
            woodlands. Warthogs play an important role in their ecosystems by
            helping to maintain the balance of vegetation and providing food for
            other animals. They are also known for their unique social structure
            and strong family bonds. Warthogs are often seen as a symbol of
            resilience and adaptability in the wild.
