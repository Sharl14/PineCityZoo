            Monkeys are highly intelligent primates known for their playful
            behavior and social structures. They are found in various habitats,
            including forests, savannas, and mountains.

          <p>
            Monkeys are known for their dexterity and ability to use tools. They
            communicate using vocalizations, facial expressions, and body
            language.

            Monkeys are social animals that live in groups called troops. They
            have complex social hierarchies and engage in grooming behaviors to
            strengthen bonds within the group.
