          <h3>LION</h3>
          <p>
            Lions are large, carnivorous mammals known for their majestic manes
            and social behavior. They are often referred to as the "king of the
            jungle" due to their strength and dominance in their habitat.
          </p>

          <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
          <p>You will find them at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
          <p>
            Lions live in groups called prides, which are made up of related
            females, their cubs, and a few adult males. This social structure
            helps them hunt and protect their territory.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most lion hunting is done by the females, who work together to catch
            prey. Lions spend much of their day resting and are most active at
            night.
