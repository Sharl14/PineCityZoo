          <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
          <p>
            Giraffes are the tallest land animals on Earth, known for their long
            necks and unique coat patterns. They are herbivores, primarily
            feeding on leaves, fruits, and flowers from trees and shrubs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Giraffes are social animals that live in loose herds. They are known
            for their long necks, which allow them to reach high branches for
            food. Giraffes have a unique coat pattern of spots that helps them
            blend into their surroundings, providing camouflage from predators.
            They communicate using a variety of vocalizations, including grunts,
            snorts, and even low-frequency sounds that can be heard over long
            distances.
          </p>
          <p>
            Giraffes are found in savannas, grasslands, and open woodlands
            across Africa. They play a crucial role in their ecosystems by
            browsing on trees and shrubs, which helps maintain the balance of
            vegetation. Unfortunately, giraffes face threats from habitat loss,
            poaching, and human-wildlife conflict. Conservation efforts are
            underway to protect these magnificent creatures and their habitats.
